<p>
I am 22 years old. I am studying on STU - Slovak technical university, faculty of "Informatic technologies". <br/>
I have experience mostly with Java, SQL and NoSQL. In Java i worked with JEE framework and GWT framework. Actually with GWT I am working right now in my job. <br/>
It is about 5 year from day when i started climb. Climbing is my passion. I think there is no better feeling than be on the top of some rock, where before you were only about 500 people from start of the earth. <br/>
My dream is go to Yosemite and climb there on the top of those rocks. I hope one day it will become true.<br/>
